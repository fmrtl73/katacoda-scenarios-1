In this step, we will use pxctl to inspect the volume

### Step: Inspect the Portworx volume

Portworx ships with a [pxctl](https://docs.portworx.com/control/status.html) command line that can be used to manage Portworx.

Below we will use pxctl to inspect the underlying volume for our PVC.

```
ssh root@node01 '/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume list'
```{{execute T1}}

Make the following observations in the volume list
* `Status` indicates the volume is attached and shows the node on which it is attached.
* `HA` shows the number of configured replicas for this volume.
* `io_profile` instructs Portworx that it should optimize for lots of file sync operations (requires HA to be 3)
* `IO Priority` shows the relative priority of this volume's IO (high, medium, or low)

Now that we have our volume created and mounted into the Redis container, let's have some fun with Redis.
