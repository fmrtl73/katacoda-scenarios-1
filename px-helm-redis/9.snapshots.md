In this step, we will take a snapshot, simulate destroy our database, and recover from the snapshot

### Step: Take snapshot using kubectl

First, take a look at px-snap.yaml ```cat px-snap.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Notice it creates a new PVC that we will then use to recover from. Let's use kubectl to take the snapshot:

```
kubectl create -f px-snap.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

You can see the snapshots using the following command:
```
kubectl get volumesnapshot,volumesnapshotdatas
```{{execute T1}}

Now we're going to go ahead and do something stupid because it's Katacoda and we're here to learn.
Run the client and in a shell.
```
 kubectl run --namespace default redis-client --rm --tty -i \
    --env REDIS_PASSWORD=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
    --image bitnami/redis:4.0.8-r0 -- bash
```{{execute T1}}

 Once you get the command promt inside the redis-client container you can start the Redis cli.

 ```
 redis-cli -h px-redis-redis -a password
 ```{{execute T1}}

Delete foo
```
del foo
```{{execute T1}}
Confirm there are no foo left  
```
get foo
```{{execute T1}}
Make sure to ```quit```{{execute T1}} the redis command line utility and ```exit```{{execute T1}} the redis container shell before continuing.

Ok, so we deleted our data, what now? Restore your snapshot and cary on.
