In this step, we will check the state of our sample redis database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

Run the client and in a shell.
```
 kubectl run px-redis-redis-client --rm --tty -i --image bitnami/redis --command -- redis --host px-redis-snap-clone-redis
```{{execute T1}}

Now use the redis shell to make sure our data is still there:
```
get foo
```{{execute T1}}

Our data is still there! Portworx snapshots makes recovering redis data easy. ```quit```{{execute T1}} from the redis client and cli and ```exit```{{execute T1}} the client shell before continuing.
