In this step, we will check the state of our sample redis database.


### Step: Restore the snapshot and see your data is still there

Snapshots are just like volumes so we can go ahead and use it to start a new instance of redis. Note here that we're leaving the old instance to carry on with it's version of the volume and we're creating a brand new instance of redis with the snapshot data!

First, lets create a new pvc, ```cat px-snap-pvc.yaml```{{execute T1}},  from the snapshot:
```
kubectl create -f px-snap-pvc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now let's deploy a second redis that uses this new PVC and make sure it came up.
```
helm install --name px-redis-snap-clone \
    --set persistence.size=1,auth.adminUser=admin,auth.adminPassword=password,persistence.existingClaim=px-redis-snap-clone \
    stable/redis
```{{execute T1}}

Verify the new redis pod is ready
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod is in running and ready state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Verify data is still available

Run the client and in a shell.
```
 kubectl run px-redis-redis-client --rm --tty -i --image bitnami/redis --command -- redis --host px-redis-snap-clone-redis
```{{execute T1}}

Now use the redis shell to make sure our data is still there:
```
get foo
```{{execute T1}}

Our data is still there! Portworx snapshots makes recovering redis data easy. ```quit```{{execute T1}} from the redis client and cli and ```exit```{{execute T1}} the client shell before continuing.
