In this step, we will deploy the postgres application using the `PersistentVolumeClaim` created before.

### Step deploy 3 instances of busybox
Take a look at the yaml:
```cat postgres-app.yaml```{{execute T1}}

Observe the `volumeMounts` and `volumes` sections where we mount the PVC.

Now use kubectl to deploy busybox.
```
kubectl create -f postgres-app.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify busybox pods are ready

Run the below command and wait till the busybox pods are in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=postgres -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When all three pods are in Running state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
