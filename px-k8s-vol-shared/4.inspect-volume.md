In this step, we will use pxctl to inspect the volume

### Step: Inspect the Portworx volume

Portworx ships with a [pxctl](https://docs.portworx.com/control/status.html) command line that can be used to manage Portworx.

Below we will use pxctl to inspect the underlying volume for our PVC.

```
ssh root@node01 '/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v l'
```{{execute T1}}

Make the following observations in the volume list
* `Status` indicates the volume is attached and shows the node on which it is attached. This is the node where the Kubernetes pod is running.
* `HA` shows the number of configured replcas for this volume
* `Shared` shows if the volume is shared
* `IO Priority` shows the relative priority of this volume's IO (high, medium, or low)

Now that we have PostgreSQL up, let's proceed to creating a sample database!
