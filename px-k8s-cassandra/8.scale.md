In this step, we will scale our Cassandra stateful set to 3 replicas

### Step: Scale the cluster

Run this command to add two nodes to the Cassandra cluster:
```
kubectl scale sts cassandra --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

Next we can run the nodetool utility to verify the health of our Cassandra cluster
```
kubectl exec -it cassandra-0 bash
watch nodetool status
```{{execute T1}}

It will take a minute or two for all three Cassandra nodes to come online and discover each other. When it's ready you should see the following output in from the `nodetool status` command (address and host ID will vary):

```
root@cassandra-0:/# nodetool status

```
When you see your Cassandra node is in Status=Up and State=Normal (UN) you can hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c our of the watch command and clear the screen.

Get the pods and the knowledge of the Hosts on which they are scheduled.

```
kubectl get pods -l app=cassandra -o json | jq '.items[] | {"name": .metadata.name,"hostname": .spec.nodeName, "hostIP": .status.hostIP, "PodIP": .status.podIP}'
```{{execute T1}}
