In this step, we will take a snapshot, simulate destroy our database, and recover from the snapshot

### Step: Scale the cluster

Run this command to addd two nodes to the Cassandra cluster:
```
kubectl scale sts cassandra --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

Next we can run the nodetool utility to verify the health of our Cassandra cluster
```
kubectl exec -it cassandra-0 bash
watch nodetool status
```{{execute T1}}

It will take a minute or two for all three Cassandra nodes to come online and discover each other. When it's ready you should see the following output in from the `nodetool status` command (address and host ID will vary):

```
root@cassandra-0:/# nodetool status
Datacenter: DC1-K8Demo
======================
Status=Up/Down
|/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
--  Address    Load       Tokens       Owns (effective)  Host ID                               Rack
UN  10.42.0.2  65.58 KiB  32           71.4%             51feacfb-ef06-4fdb-bac7-032870261c1d  Rack1-K8Demo
UN  10.42.0.3  65.58 KiB  32           71.4%             51feacfb-ef06-4fdb-bac7-032870261c1d  Rack1-K8Demo
UN  10.42.0.4  65.58 KiB  32           71.4%             51feacfb-ef06-4fdb-bac7-032870261c1d  Rack1-K8Demo
```
When you see your Cassandra node is in Status=Up and State=Normal (UN) you can hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c our of the watch command and clear the screen.

### Step: Take snapshot using kubectl

First, take a look at px-snap.yaml ```cat px-snap.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Notice it creates a new PVC that we will then use to recover from. Let's use kubectl to take the snapshot:

```
kubectl create -f px-snap.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

You can see the snapshots using the following command:
```
kubectl get volumesnapshot,volumesnapshotdatas
```{{execute T1}}

Now we're going to go ahead and do something stupid because it's Katacoda and we're here to learn.

```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=cassandra | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
psql
drop database pxdemo;
\l
\q
exit
```{{execute T1}}

Ok, so we deleted our database, what now? Restore your snapshot and cary on.

### Step: Restore the snapshot and see your data is still there

Snapshots are just like volumes so we can go ahead and use it to start a new instance of cassandraSQL. Note here that we're leaving the old instance to carry on with it's version of the volume and we're creating a brand new instance of cassandraSQL with the snapshot data!

First, lets create a new pvc, ``cat px-snap-pvc.yaml```{{execute T1}},  from the snapshot:
```
kubectl create -f px-snap-pvc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Now, lets look at the yaml: .

Now let's deploy a second cassandraSQL that uses this new PVC, ```cat cassandra-app-restore.yaml```{{execute T1}}, and make sure it came up.
```
kubectl create -f cassandra-app-restore.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify cassandra pod is ready

Below commands wait till the cassandra pods are in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=cassandra-snap -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod is in Running state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
