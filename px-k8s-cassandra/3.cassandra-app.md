In this step, we will deploy a 3 node Cassandra application using a stateful set. To learn more about stateful sets follow this [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).

### Step: Create storage class with 2 replicas

Take a look at the StorageClass definition for Portworx
```
cat px-repl2-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

The parameters are declarative policies for your storage volume. See [here](https://docs.portworx.com/manage/volumes.html) for a full list of supported parameters.

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f px-repl2-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}


Create a cassandra [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) that uses a Portworx PVC.

Take a look at the yaml:
```cat cassandra-app.yaml```{{execute T1}}

Observe the `volumeClaimTemplates` and it's `storage-class` sections where we dynamically create PVCs.

Now use kubectl to deploy cassandra.
```
kubectl create -f cassandra-app.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify cassandra pod is ready

Below commands wait till the cassandra pods are in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=cassandra -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

This takes a few minutes as the stateful set starts one container at a time and waits for it to be ready before starting the next one. When the all three Cassandra pods are in STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Notice they all started on different nodes.
