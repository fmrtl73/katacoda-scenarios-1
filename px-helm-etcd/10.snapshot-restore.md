In this step, we will restore the snapshot of our etcd volumes and show how our topic and it's message history can be recovered.

### Step: Restore your volumes to the snapshot state

Now let's open a shell in one of our Portworx containers:
```
PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -n kube-system -it $PX_POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Then iterate through the group snapshot volumes and first delete the original volume before cloning the snapshot using the same name.
```
for pvc in `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v l | grep group | awk '{print $2}'`; \
  do /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v d ${pvc:24:100} -f; /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v clone --name ${pvc:24:100} $pvc; done
exit
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Scale your StatefulSet back up to 3 and verify your test topic is back
```
kubectl scale sts px-etcd-etcd --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure you wait for all three ETCD pods to be started and ready:
```
watch kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}

When all three px-etcd-etcd-* pods are ready hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen and then verify that your test topic is back and has the full data history:
```
ETCD_IP=`kubectl get svc | grep px-etcd | head -n 1 | awk '{print $3}'`
curl http://$ETCD_IP:2379/v2/keys/key1
```{{execute T1}}
