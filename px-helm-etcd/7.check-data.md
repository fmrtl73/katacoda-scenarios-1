In this step, we will check the state of our sample ETCD database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

List the members, px-etcd-etcd-0 should no longer be the leader.
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- bin/etcdctl member list
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify data is still available

We can retrieve the values using both the etcdctl command line utility or the REST API:
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- ./bin/etcdctl get key1
```{{execute T1}}
```
curl http://$ETCD_IP:2379/v2/keys/key2
```{{execute T1}}

Our data is still there! Portworx replication makes handling ETCD failover easy.

### Step: What happens if I kill all the pods?

Go on, try it...
```
kubectl delete pod px-etcd-etcd-0 px-etcd-etcd-1 px-etcd-etcd-2
```{{execute T1}}

Now watch it come back to life.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l app=etcd -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pods come back up it will be in the Running state. When it does hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Now list the members and get your key to verify the data is intact.
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- bin/etcdctl member list
```{{execute T1}}
```
curl http://$ETCD_IP:2379/v2/keys/key2
```{{execute T1}}
