In this step, we will start a Redis client and have some fun!

### Step: Check that ETCD is running

The helm chart will have deployed a Kubernetes service so that we can contact ETCD. Let's get the IP for ETCD and write it to an environment variable and then test it by getting the ETCD version number.
```
ETCD_IP=`kubectl get svc | grep px-etcd | head -n 1 | awk '{print $3}'`
curl http://$ETCD_IP:2379/version
```{{execute T1}}

List the members, px-etcd-etcd-0 should be the leader.
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- bin/etcdctl member list
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Create and query data

We can use the etcdctl command line utility or the REST API to set key/value pairs:
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- ./bin/etcdctl set key1 value1
```{{execute T1}}
```
curl http://$ETCD_IP:2379/v2/keys/key2 -XPUT -d value="value2"
```{{execute T1}}

We can retrieve the values using both the etcdctl command line utility or the REST API:
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- ./bin/etcdctl get key1
```{{execute T1}}
```
curl http://$ETCD_IP:2379/v2/keys/key2
```{{execute T1}}
