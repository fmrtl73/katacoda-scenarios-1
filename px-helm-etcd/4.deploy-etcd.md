In this step, we will install ETCD using Helm.

### Step: Install the Bitnami ETCD chart

Use Helm to install ETCD, with name _px-etcd_ and with the _persistence.storageClass_ parameter used to pass in the name of the StorageClass we just created. For a complete list of available parameters check out the chart's repo [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/etcd).
```
git clone https://github.com/fmrtl73/chart-1
cd bitnami/etcd
helm install --name px-etcd \
    --set auth.rbac.enabled=false \
    --set persistence.storageClass=px-ha-sc \
    .
```{{execute T1}}

That's it! Isn't helm great? We think it is.

### Step: Wait for ETCD to start

Run the below command and wait for the ETCD pod to be in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the ETCD pod is in Running state then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Be patient, if it's staying in Pending state for a while it's because it has to fetch the docker image.
