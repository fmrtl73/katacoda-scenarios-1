In this step, we will create a lot of data very fast with the dd command.

### Step: Copy data into the nginx html folder

Generate a 1gb file and find out the POD id:
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/1bg.img bs=1024 count=$[1024*1000]
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
```{{execute T1}}

Copy the file to the nginx mounted folder /usr/share/nginx/html

```
kubectl cp 1gb.img $POD:/usr/share/nginx/html/1gb.img
```{{execute T1}}

Upload the 1gb file again to go over the limit

```
kubectl cp 1gb.img $POD:/usr/share/nginx/html/2gb.img
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Expand the volume to accomodate the 1GB file

This will run in _Terminal 2_ and get the volume id:
```
ssh node01
POD=`/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume list | grep pvc | awk '{print $1}'`
```{{execute T2}}

inspect the volume:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i $POD
```{{execute T2}}

As you can see the volume is within 10% of full and so we need to expand it using the following command:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume update $POD --size=2
```{{execute T2}}

We can now go back to _Terminal 1_ and add another large file:
```
kubectl cp 1gb.img $POD:/usr/share/nginx/html/2gb.img
```{{execute T1}}

inspect the volume again on _Terminal 2_ to see it has expanded to 1.9 Gib size:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i $POD
```{{execute T2}}
