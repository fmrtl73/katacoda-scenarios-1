In this step, we will check the state of our sample postgres database.

### Step: Get into your nginx container and start creating data

Open a shell inside of your container. This will execute in _Terminal 1_:
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp1 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Generate just under 1GB of data in the mounted folder /usr/share/nginx/html

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/share/nginx/html/test.img bs=10240 count=0 seek=10240
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Expand the volume to accomodate the 1GB file
