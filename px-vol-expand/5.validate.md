In this step, we will check the state of our sample postgres database.

### Step: Get into your nginx container and start creating data

Open a shell inside of your container. This will execute in _Terminal 1_:
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Generate just under 1GB of data in the mounted folder /usr/share/nginx/html

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=test1.img bs=1024 count=$[1024*1000]
```{{execute T1}}

Generate another large file - won't work since the volume max size is 1G

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=test2.img bs=1024 count=$[1024*1000]
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Expand the volume to accomodate the 1GB file

This will run in _Terminal 2_ and inspect the volumes:
```
ssh node01
POD=`/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume list | grep pvc | awk '{print $1}'`
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i $POD
```{{execute T2}}

As you can see the volume is within 10% of full and so we need to expand it using the following command:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume update $POD --size=2
```{{execute T2}}

We can now go back to _Terminal 1_ and add another large file:
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=test2.img bs=1024 count=$[1024*1000]
```{{execute T1}}
