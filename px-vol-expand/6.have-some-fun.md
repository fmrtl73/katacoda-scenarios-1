In this step, we will play some file ping pong

### Step: Have some fun with file ping pong

Let's open a couple more terminals and have fun with shared volumes.

Open a terminal for webapp2 and create ping file, this will execute in  _Terminal 3_.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp2 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
echo "pong" > /usr/share/nginx/html/ping
```{{execute T3}}

Open a new terminal for webapp3 and create pong file, this will execute in  _Terminal 4_.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=webapp3 | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
echo "ping" > /usr/share/nginx/html/pong
```{{execute T4}}

Now let's go back to _Terminal 2_ and see our ping pong files
```
cat /usr/share/nginx/html/*
```{{execute T2}}

Or better yet, try curl it on any of the web apps back on _Terminal 1_:
```
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp1-svc | awk '{print $3}'` && curl $IP/ping
IP=`kubectl get svc | grep webapp1-svc | awk '{print $3}'` && curl $IP/pong
```{{execute T1}}


You can have some more fun by using terminals 2,3,4 to see how they all share data in the mounted /usr/share/nginx/html folder.
