In this step, we will use pxctl to watch the volume

### Step: Watch the Portworx volume

Portworx ships with a [pxctl](https://docs.portworx.com/control/status.html) command line that can be used to manage Portworx.

Below we will use pxctl to inspect the underlying volume for our PVC. It will launch in _Terminal 2_

```
VOL=`kubectl get pvc | grep px-basic-pvc | awk '{print $3}'`
PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume inspect ${VOL}
```{{execute T1}}

Make the following observations in the volume list
* `Status` indicates the volume is attached and shows the node on which it is attached.
* `Size` shows the maximum size of the volume
* `IO Priority` shows the relative priority of this volume's IO (high, medium, or low)

Now that we have our volume created and mounted into our nginx container, let's proceed to write some data into the html folder of nginx and see what happens when we run out of space.
