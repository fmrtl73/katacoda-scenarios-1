Let's first wait for Kubernetes and Portworx to be ready.

### Step: Wait for Kubernetes to be ready

Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get nodes
```{{execute T1}}

When all 4 nodes show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Install Helm

First, create a service account. Warning: this is not how you should secure Helm, take a look at [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/securing_installation.md) for more information.

```
kubectl create -f helm-service-account.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Second, install Helm
```wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.8.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
gunzip helm-v2.8.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xf helm-v2.8.1-linux-amd64.tar
cp linux-amd64/helm /usr/bin
helm init --service-account helm
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure Tiller starts up before you continue
```
watch "kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep 'tiller\|NAME'"
```{{execute T1}}

When Tiller is in Running state you can ctr-c and clear the screen by hitting ```clear```{{execute interrupt}}.

Check out helm charts [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/), in a couple of steps we will be installing the Redis chart but first we need to create a storage class and PVC.

### Step: Wait for Portworx to be ready

Watch the Portworx pods and wait for them to be ready on all the nodes. This can take a few minutes since it involves pulling multiple docker images. You will see 'No resources found' until all images are pulled.

```
watch kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l name=portworx -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When all the pods show STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Now that we have the Portworx cluster up, let's proceed to the next step!
