In this step, we will deploy Zookeeper using a StatefulSet.

### Step: Deploy Zookeeper StatefulSet

A [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods , and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. It also allows us to dynamically create Portworx volumes using a VolumeClaimTemplate.

Let's take a look at the StatfulSet for Zookeeper: ```cat zk-ss.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that the reference to our Zookeeper storage class in the VolumeClaimTemplate definition.

Now let's deploy Zookeeper:

```
kubectl create -f zk-ss.yaml
```{{execute T1}}
