In this step, we will deploy Zookeeper using a StatefulSet.

### Step: Create Zookeeper PDB and Service

A [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) is used to limit the number of concurrent disruptions that your application experiences, allowing for higher availability while permitting the cluster administrator to manage the clusters nodes.

Let's take a look at the PDB for Zookeeper: ```cat zk-pdb.yaml```{{execute T1}}. 

Now let's deploy Zookeeper PDB:

```
kubectl create -f zk-pdb.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

We're also going to create a service for Zookeeper so that Kafka can connect to the Zookeeper cluster. Take a look at the service definition ```cat zk-svc.yaml```{{execute T1}} and deploy it:
```
kubectl create -f zk-svc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Deploy Zookeeper StatefulSet

A [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods , and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. It also allows us to dynamically create Portworx volumes using a VolumeClaimTemplate.

Let's take a look at the StatfulSet for Zookeeper: ```cat zk-ss.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that the reference to our Zookeeper storage class in the VolumeClaimTemplate definition.

Now let's deploy Zookeeper:

```
kubectl create -f zk-ss.yaml
```{{execute T1}}
