In this step, we will create a Portworx volumes (k8s PVCs) for Zookeeper and Kafka.

### Step: Create StorageClass for Zookeeper and Kafka

Take a look at the StorageClass definitions for Portworx: ```cat px-ha-sc.yaml```{{execute T1}}

The parameters are declarative policies for your storage volume. See [here](https://docs.portworx.com/manage/volumes.html) for a full list of supported parameters.

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f px-ha-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}


We don't need to create the volumes because we're going to use a stateful sets and volume claim templates to create them dynamically in the next steps.
