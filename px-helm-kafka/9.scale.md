In this step, we will show how you can scale your Kafka cluster.

### Step: Take snapshot using kubectl

The Kafka helm chart we installed uses an implementation of stateful sets found [here](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka). We can easily scale the stateful set instances using the following command.

```
kubectl scale statefulsets pxkafka-kafka --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

Verify the two new Kafka broker pods are starting up.
```
watch kubectl get pods -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When the pod is in running and ready state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
