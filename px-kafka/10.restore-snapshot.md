In this step, we will take a snapshot of our Kafka volumes and show how it can be recovered from the snapshot.

### Step: Restore your volumes to the snapshot state

First, let's get the list of volumes
```
PVC_LIST=`kubectl get pvc | grep kafka | awk '{print $3}'`
echo $PVC_LIST
```{{execute T1}}

Second, let's get the list of snapshots for these volumes
```
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v l -s | grep -v ID | awk '{print $2}' > snaplist.txt
cat snaplist.txt
```{{execute T1}}

Now we can iterate through the list of PVC and find their respective snapshots so that we have two arrays of pvcs and their matching snaps.
```
define -ar pvcs = ( $PVC_LIST )
define -ar snaps
for i in 0 1 2; do snaps[$i]=`cat snaplist.txt | grep ${pvcs[$i]}`; done
```{{execute T1}}

And now we can restore each volume in the pvcs array to the respective snapshot in the snaps array.
```
for i in 0 1 2; do kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v restore -s ${snaps[$i]} ${pvcs[$i]}; done
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Scale your StatefulSet back up to 3 and verify your test topic is back
```
kubectl scale sts kafka --replicas=3
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure you wait for all three kafka pods to be started and ready:
```
watch kubectl get pods
```{{execute T1}}

When all three kafka-* pods are ready hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen and then verify that your test topic is back and has the full data history:
```
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-broker:9092 --topic test --partition 0 --from-beginning
```{{execute T1}}
