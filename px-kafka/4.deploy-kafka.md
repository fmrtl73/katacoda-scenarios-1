In this step, we will deploy Kafka using a StatefulSet.

### Step: Create Kafka Namespace, ConfigMap, and Service

We're going to run Kafka in it's own namespace. Along with creating the namespace, we're going to create a ConfigMap and Service for Kafka.  First, take a look at these configurations: ```cat kafka-config.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that we are using the svc name for Zookeeper in our ConfigMap.

Now let's create them using kubectl:

```
kubectl create -f kafka-config.yaml
```{{execute T1}}


### Step: Deploy Kafka StatefulSet

Let's take a look at the StatefulSet for Kafka: ```cat kafka-ss.yaml```{{execute T1}}. Note that the reference to our Zookeeper storage class in the VolumeClaimTemplate definition.

Now let's deploy Kafka:

```
kubectl create -f zk-ss.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify that Zookeeper StatefulSet is finished initializing

The stateful set will create three pods (zk-0, zk-1, and zk-2). These pods will start in a controlled sequence so that the Zookeeper cluster can achieve quorum and elect a master. Please wait untill all three pods are in Running state before continuing to the next step.

When all the 3 zk-* pods show STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
