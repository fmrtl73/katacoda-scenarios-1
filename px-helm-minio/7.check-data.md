In this step, we will check the state of our sample ETCD database.

### Step: Verify data is still available

List the members, px-etcd-etcd-0 should no longer be the leader.
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- bin/etcdctl member list
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify data is still available

We can retrieve the values using both the etcdctl command line utility or the REST API:
```
kubectl exec -it px-etcd-etcd-0 -- ./bin/etcdctl get key1
```{{execute T1}}
```
curl http://$ETCD_IP:2379/v2/keys/key2
```{{execute T1}}

Our data is still there! Portworx replication makes handling ETCD failover easy.
