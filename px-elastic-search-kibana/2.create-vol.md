In this step, we will create a StorageClass for Elastic Search.

### Step: Create StorageClass and PersistentVolumeClaim

Take a look at the StorageClass definition for Portworx
```
cat storage-class.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

This storage class creates a replica 2 Portworx volume when reference via a PersistentVolumeClaim. It also defines a group name so that we can manage all volumes related to Elastic Search as a consistency group for snapshots and backups. The parameters are declarative policies for your storage volume. See [here](https://docs.portworx.com/manage/volumes.html) for a full list of supported parameters.

Create the StorageClass:
```
kubectl create -f storage-class.yaml
```{{execute T1}}
Now that we have the storage class created, let's deploy Elastic Search!
